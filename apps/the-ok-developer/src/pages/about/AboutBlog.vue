            Are you a mythical 10x developer that grinds 80 hour weeks, builds things in Assembly to
            maximize perf, and writes perfect code that doesn't need to be unit tested? Great, this
            blog isn't for you.
            <br/><br/>
            As the website name implies, this is meant to help perfectly average, 9 to 5, occasionally confused
            developers that are interested in picking up some new information. None of the topics
            are going to be overly complex, and mostly cover topics that I am currently struggling with
            or leaning.
            <br/><br/>
            No self-respecting Fullstack engineer should be using a website builder (except it's faster
            and less buggy), so this blog website is hand built using Vue, Vite, Typescript, and Quasar
            in a Turbo monorepo. Gotta make it more complicated than necessary to impress those HMs.
            It uses shared components to support two different blog applications. See the 'Other Links' section to see my other websites.
