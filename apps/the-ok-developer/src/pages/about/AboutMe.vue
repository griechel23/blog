  <q-card title="Me">
    I grew up in the Pacific Northwest and after fumbling through the classic little league sports, found my niche
    as a competitive swimmer. I attended Stanford (class of `14) and graduated with a major in Bioinformatics, which is a
    Computer Science degree for people with too many premed credits. I stuck around to do my time working in Silicon Valley,
    until eventually escaping to Colorado.

    Today I live in Breckenridge with my wife and two dogs. Naturally, this means I do a lot of skiing and mountain biking,
    but I also dabble in photography and homebrewing. I am slowly trying to be more involved in the mountain community, and
    am a volunteer at the Frisco Animal Shelter and was appointed to the Breckenridge Liquor and Marijuana Licensing
    Authority board in 2023.
